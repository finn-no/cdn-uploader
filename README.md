[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/finn-no/cdn-uploader.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

## Requirements

You must either specify key-filename or specify credentials which is a base64
encoded `JSON.stringify` version of the JSON based keyfile containing
credentials used when talking to Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

```javascript
//base 64 encoded keyfile
const credentials = require('keyfile.json');
const credentialString = JSON.stringify(credentials);
return new Buffer(credentialString).toString('base64');
```

## Usage

Install:

```sh-session
$ npm install @finn-no/cdn-uploader -g
```

Actual usage:

```sh-session
$ cdn-uploader -a test-app /tmp/cdn-assets
-- Uploaded assets --
test-app/example.jpg
test-app/css/example.css
test-app/js/example.js
```

All options can also be set as environment variables, using the `CDN_UPLOADER_`
prefix. E.g.: `CDN_UPLOADER_APP_PREFIX`, `CDN_UPLOADER_CREDENTIALS`, etc.

### Excluded files

All files or folder beginning with a "." is automatically excluded (e.g.
`.gitignore`) and will not be uploaded.

### Advanced

You may also override other options if you like (handy for testing)

- `--key-filename` - JSON key file used to authenticate with GCP. If not set
  CDN_UPLOADER_CREDENTIALS environment variable is used.
- `--bucket-name` - GCS bucket to use.
- `--project-id` - GCS projectId.

You can also use environment variables for these options, just use the prefix
`CDN_UPLOADER_`.

## Where does my files end up?

The files uploaded to GCS is made available on the public GCS hosting at:

`https://storage.googleapis.com/<bucket-name>/<app-prefix>/<assetName>`

This is again exposed by our CDN at:

`https://static.finncdn.no/_c/<app-prefix>/<assetName>`

## Cache time?

All files uploaded to CDN is configured with
`Cache-Control: public, max-age=2592000`, meaning that clients may cache the
assets for up to 30 days.
